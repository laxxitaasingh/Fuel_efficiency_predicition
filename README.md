## Fuel Efficiency ML Model
This repository contains a Machine Learning (ML) model that predicts the fuel efficiency of vehicles from the 1970s. The model utilizes historical data to estimate the fuel consumption based on various features of the vehicles.

## Dataset
The dataset used to train the model consists of information about different vehicles manufactured in the 1970s. It includes attributes such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accurate predictions.

## Model Architecture
The ML model is built using a regression algorithm to predict the fuel efficiency of the vehicles. It is trained on the processed dataset, learning patterns and relationships between the input features and the target variable (fuel efficiency). The model is implemented using Python and popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn.

## Deployment
To make the model accessible and usable, it has been deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform that supports the hosting of web applications. The deployed model provides a simple and intuitive web interface, allowing users to input the relevant vehicle features and receive a prediction of the fuel efficiency.

## Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:

* Open the deployed web application on Heroku.
* Enter the required information about the vehicle, such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year.
* Click the "Predict" button to generate the estimated fuel efficiency for the given input.
* Review the predicted fuel efficiency value displayed on the screen.
